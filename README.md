# The Qsitory project

## About this project

*Qsitory is a new programming language that supports the functional programming language features such as higher-order functions and recursive functions with some useful features. *

*Currently this project develops an interpreter for Qsitory. *

## Why is Qsitory benefit

*Qsitory has some features like other languages do not have.*

### multi-dimensional 'enhanced loop statement'

*It is like Java's 'enhanced loop statement' and Python's 'for statement'.
'Enhanced loop statement' is taking an element from a list and putting it in a variable and repeating. But also Qsitory enabled multiple lists.So you can eliminate the need to write many similar 'for statement'!*

### dynamic structure

*Generally, the structure has unchanging after definition. But, Qsitory enabled change structure's field at any time. So whenever you be forced to add a field in the structure through an update you may not need to modify every part of this structure involved in the code.*
